# GAME OF LIFE
This script is a work done in the first year of my engineering degree.<br>
The program was written in java and this script is an improved adaptation in python.<br>
The script consists of simulating the famous game of life.<br>
In the script 'example.py' the initial points that are alive are defined and the program shows the evolution of the population.<br>
The following image shows the sequence obtained with the initial points: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,0).<br>
